# Coordinate-Based-Image-Reconstruction
This project implements coordinate-based neural networks from scratch in NumPy to reconstruct low- and high-resolution images from 2D pixel coordinates. It explores input encoding strategies—none, basic, and Gaussian Fourier features—to evaluate their impact on image quality and detail. Tech: Python (numpy, cv2, os)
